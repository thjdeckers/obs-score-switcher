This Javascript plugin can be used with the sporttech.io scoring system to automatically switch scenes during livestreaming with Open Broadcaster Software. In the video tutorial http://youtu.be/xKVxbHNX3jc it is shown how to define 3 scenes in OBS: full video (full screen live video), video & name (full screen live video + overlay of the athlete name), video & score (smaller live video + results).

The plugin automatically switches the livestream between these 3 scenes in OBS, remotely controlled by the Chair of Judges Panel, as is explained in the video tutorial.

The repository also contains the Dutch translation files for TRA and common.
